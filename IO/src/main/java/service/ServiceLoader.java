/**
 * A generic service loader designed for dynamically loading and instantiating service classes
 * from a specified package. These service classes must either implement a given interface or
 * extend a specified base class. This flexible mechanism allows for the modular and dynamic
 * addition of services at runtime, which can significantly enhance the application's extensibility
 * and maintainability.
 * <p>
 * In addition to loading services, this class supports the use of a {@link ServiceInterceptor}
 * which provides a hook for custom logic to be executed immediately after a service instance is
 * created and before it is added to the collection of service instances. This interceptor can
 * perform tasks such as initialization, configuration, or validation of service instances,
 * allowing for more complex and dynamic service management.
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * <pre>
 * ServiceLoader<MyServiceInterface> loader = ServiceLoader.load("com.example.services", MyServiceInterface.class, service -> {
 *         // Perform interception logic, return true to accept the service, or false to reject it.
 *         return true;
 *     }
 * );
 * for (MyServiceInterface service : loader) {
 *     // Use the service
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T> The type parameter representing the interface or base class that the service classes
 *            should implement or extend. This ensures that all loaded services adhere to a
 *            consistent contract, facilitating their usage throughout the application.
 * @author Albert Beaupre
 * @version 1.0
 * @see ServiceInterceptor for details on intercepting and processing service instances.
