/**
 * The ServiceInterceptor interface defines a single method for intercepting and handling services
 * of a specified type immediately after they are instantiated but before they are returned or used by the
 * ServiceLoader. This interception mechanism allows for additional processing, such as initialization,
 * configuration, or validation of service instances.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface can modify, wrap, or replace service instances, offering a flexible
 * means to extend or customize the behavior of dynamically loaded services. This interface is particularly
 * useful for cross-cutting concerns that apply to all instances of a service type, such as logging,
 * security checks, or dependency injection.
 * <p>
 * Note: Implementors of this interface must ensure that the intercept method is thread-safe if the
 * ServiceLoader and services are intended to be used in a concurrent environment.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the service interface or base class that the interceptor is concerned with. This
 *            ensures that the intercept method receives instances of the correct type.
